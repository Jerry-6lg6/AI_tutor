            "Don't worry if you don't understand how #include <iostream> and using namespace std works. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.",
            "Line 3: A blank line. C++ ignores white space. But we use it \nto make the code more readable.",
            "Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program is int main(). This is called a \nfunction. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.",
            "Line 5: cout (pronounced \"see-out\") is an \nobject used together with the insertion operator (<<) \nto output/print text. In our example, it will output \"Hello World!\".",
