            "To allocate dynamic memory, you can use the malloc() or calloc() functions. It is necessary to include the <stdlib.h> header to use them. The malloc() and calloc() functions allocate some memory and return a pointer to its address.",

            "Note: The data in the memory allocated by malloc() is unpredictable. To avoid unexpected values, make sure to write something into the memory before reading it.\nUnlike malloc(), the calloc() function writes zeroes into all of the allocated memory. However, this makes calloc() slightly less efficient.",
            "The best way to allocate the right amount of memory for a data type is to use the sizeof operator:",

If you forget the * and write sizeof(ptr1) instead, it will measure the size of the pointer itself, which is the (usually) 8 bytes that are needed to store a memory address.\nNote: The sizeof operator cannot measure how much dynamic memory is allocated. When measuring dynamic memory, it only tells you the size of the data type of the memory. For example, if you reserve space for 5 float values, the sizeof operator will return 4, which is the number of bytes needed for a single float value.",
