            "Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning method for clustering data points. The algorithm builds clusters by measuring the dissimilarities between data. Unsupervised learning means that a model does not have to be trained, and we do not need a \"target\" variable. This method can be used on any data to visualize and interpret the relationship between individual data points.",
